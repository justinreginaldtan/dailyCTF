# dailyCTF — My Journey to Red Teaming

Hi, I’m **Justin Reginald Tan** — a senior CIS student passionate about red teaming and web application security.  

`dailyCTF` started in **May 2025** as a personal challenge: solve **one CTF or lab every day for a month** and document the journey. What began as a consistency experiment has grown into a full collection of **31 write-ups**, covering everything from beginner web exploits to multi-stage privilege escalation chains.  

This repo is both a technical logbook and a personal archive of growth, a place to show my process, share mistakes, and highlight lessons learned.

## Why I’m Doing This

CTFs and hands-on labs aren’t just puzzles, but they are **reps for real-world offensive security**. Through this series I practiced:  

- Web exploitation (XSS, SQLi, file upload, XXE, SSTI, command injection)  
- Network services enumeration (SMTP, SNMP, IMAP/POP3, NFS, DNS)  
- Reverse engineering and pwn challenges  
- Linux privilege escalation and misconfigurations  
- Chaining smaller vulnerabilities into full compromises  

I also wanted to prepare for certifications like **OSCP / CPTS** while building the discipline of daily problem-solving.

## What You’ll Find Here

Each daily folder (Day01 → Day31) contains a **Markdown write-up** with:  

- Challenge overview and scenario  
- Reconnaissance and methodology  
- Exploitation steps (commands, payloads, screenshots where needed)  
- Lessons learned and key takeaways  

Not every day was a strict CTF. Some entries are **HackTheBox Academy skill assessments** or training modules that matched the same learning goals.
